# DOM Atomic 02: Hide Many Elements

## Questions

---

> How did you go about selecting the DOM elements to hide? Describe the "contract" for that function.

I looked at the text on the web page when I loaded it and saw that certain lines had the class 'hide_me', so I took that as a good clue.

> Describe how you were able to hide each element. Were you able to do it as one operation, or did you use a loop of some kind? Describe the "contracts" that were utilized to accomplish your goal.

There was a loop involved, but I never would've guessed that without looking at the solution file. I used a loop to iterate through each object in the 'these are the things I want to hide' collection.
