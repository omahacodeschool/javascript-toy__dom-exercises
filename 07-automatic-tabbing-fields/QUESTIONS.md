I'm thinking that this could be refactored using a 'for' loop to cutdown on reptition.

I was able to refactor using a 'for' loop but it took some doing and quite a bit of help from Sumeet. To further refactor, I would probably place the 'if' conditional in its own method but I'll leave that for another time.
