# DOM Atomic 05: Toggle Elements of DOM Path

## Questions

---

> Describe the contract you used for finding the movies to toggle in the DOM. How is this function different from other functions that find elements in the DOM?

The only difference here was that I needed to be more specific with the string entered to search for my 'text_to_toggle' variable. I called querySelectorAll to search for all objects with the 'second_five' class and with the 'li' tag.
