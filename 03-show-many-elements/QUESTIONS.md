# DOM Atomic 03: Show Many Elements

> How did you go about hiding elements initially?

I used the 'for' loop again in order to apply the 'style.display = "block"' pieces of the block to each element in question, as with the second exercise. In index.html, for each element in question, I set the style to 'display: none' in order hide them until the click event. Following the click event, the prevously hidden bits are revealed and the link that revealed them hidden.
