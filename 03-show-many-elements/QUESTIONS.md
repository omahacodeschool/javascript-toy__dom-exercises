# DOM Atomic 03: Show Many Elements

> How did you go about hiding elements initially?

Initially I tried using style="visibility:hidden",
which was a poor choice, as the elements were still on the page, but not visible.
It left a bunch of white space, rather than just moving the button up further on the page.
Given what I observed and read, "display:none" won't even put the element on the page, which
makes more a less patchwork feel.
