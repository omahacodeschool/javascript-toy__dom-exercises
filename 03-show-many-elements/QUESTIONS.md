# DOM Atomic 03: Show Many Elements

## Questions

> How did you go about hiding elements initially?

I think the question is supposed to say "showing" instead of "hiding"? Anyway, I had to use the solution, but it goes about showing elements by retrieving them by their show_me class name, then looping through that collection incrementally and changing display values to "block" (which is just a style option).
